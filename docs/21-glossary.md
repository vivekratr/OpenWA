# 21 - Glossary

## A

### ACK (Acknowledgement)
Delivery acknowledgment status. WhatsApp ACK levels:
- `error` (-1): Failed to send
- `pending` (0): Pending
- `server` (1): Sent to WhatsApp server
- `device` (2): Delivered to recipient device
- `read` (3): Read by recipient
- `played` (4): Media played (audio/video)

### Adapter
An interface implementation that provides a specific capability. In OpenWA, adapters are used for:
- **Database Adapter**: SQLite, PostgreSQL
- **Storage Adapter**: Local, S3
- **Cache Adapter**: Memory, Redis
- **Engine Adapter**: whatsapp-web.js, Baileys (future)

### API Key
Authentication token to access the OpenWA API. Sent via the `X-API-Key` header.

### Auth State
WhatsApp Web session authentication data stored in the `.wwebjs_auth/` folder. Includes cookies, session storage, and Chrome profile data.

## B

### Baileys
An alternative Node.js library for WhatsApp Web that uses WebSocket directly without a browser. Lighter but easier to detect.

### Broadcast
Sending the same message to multiple recipients. On WhatsApp, this differs from the native "Broadcast List" feature.

### Bull
A Redis-based Node.js job queue library. Used for:
- Message queue (delayed sends)
- Webhook delivery queue (retry mechanism)
- Background tasks

## C

### Chat ID
Unique identifier for a WhatsApp chat:
- Individual: `628123456789@c.us`
- Group: `120363123456789@g.us`
- Status: `status@broadcast`

### Chrome/Chromium
Browser used by Puppeteer to run WhatsApp Web. OpenWA uses headless Chromium.

### Compose
Docker Compose - a tool to define and run multi-container Docker applications.

## D

### Dashboard
Web interface to manage OpenWA without using the API directly. Built with React + shadcn/ui.

### Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)
Queue that stores messages that failed after all retry attempts. Used for debugging and manual retry.

### Docker
Containerization platform for packaging and deploying applications. OpenWA is distributed as a Docker image.

## E

### Engine
Component that handles communication with WhatsApp Web. The primary engine used is `whatsapp-web.js`.

### Event
A system-emitted occurrence, for example:
- `message.received`: New incoming message
- `message.ack`: Message status changed
- `session.status`: Session status changed
- `session.qr`: New QR code generated

## F

### Factory Pattern
Design pattern used to create adapter instances based on configuration. Example: `DatabaseAdapterFactory.create()`.

## G

### Group ID
Unique identifier for a WhatsApp group. Format: `120363123456789@g.us`.

### GHCR
GitHub Container Registry - registry for storing Docker images. The OpenWA image is available at `ghcr.io/rmyndharis/openwa`.

## H

### Headless
Browser mode that runs without a GUI. Puppeteer runs Chrome in headless mode.

### Health Check
Endpoint to check system health. `/health` is public for basic status, `/health/detailed` requires an API key for full status.

### Hook
An extension point that allows plugins to intercept and modify processing flows.

## I

### In-Memory
Data stored in RAM. Fast but non-persistent. Used for cache in minimal deployments.

## J

### JID (Jabber ID)
Identifier format in the XMPP protocol used by WhatsApp. Same as Chat ID.

### Job Queue
Queueing system for asynchronous task processing. Used for webhook delivery and message scheduling.

## L

### Linked Device
WhatsApp feature that allows up to 4 additional devices to be linked to one account without requiring an active phone connection.

### Lucide
Icon library used in the dashboard. A fork of Feather Icons with more icons.

## M

### Message Queue
Queue for asynchronous message delivery. Prevents rate limiting and ensures message ordering.

### Middleware
Function executed before a request handler in NestJS. Used for logging, authentication, etc.

### MinIO
Object storage server compatible with the S3 API. Can be used as a self-hosted alternative to S3.

### Multi-session
Ability to run multiple WhatsApp sessions within a single OpenWA instance.

## N

### NestJS
Node.js framework for building server-side applications. The OpenWA backend is built with NestJS.

### Node.js
JavaScript runtime used to run OpenWA. Supported version: Node.js 20 LTS.

## O

### ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
Library that maps objects in code to database tables. OpenWA uses TypeORM.

### OpenWA
Open-source WhatsApp API gateway. This project.

## P

### Payload
Data sent in an HTTP request body or webhook delivery.

### Plugin
Extension that can be added to OpenWA to add functionality without modifying the core codebase.

### PostgreSQL
Relational database recommended for production deployments with multiple sessions.

### Puppeteer
Node.js library for controlling Chrome/Chromium. Used by whatsapp-web.js.

### Push Name
Display name shown in a user's WhatsApp profile.

## Q

### QR Code
Code that must be scanned in WhatsApp on a phone to connect a new session.

### Queue
Queue for processing tasks sequentially and asynchronously.

## R

### Rate Limiting
Limiting request volume over time to prevent abuse and WhatsApp bans.

### Redis
In-memory data store used for:
- Caching
- Message queue (with Bull)
- Session storage
- Real-time pub/sub

### REST API
Architectural style for APIs used by OpenWA. Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

### Retry
Mechanism to retry failed operations, e.g., webhook delivery.

## S

### S3 (Simple Storage Service)
AWS object storage service. OpenWA supports S3-compatible storage for media files.

### Session
An instance of a WhatsApp Web connection. One phone number = one session.

### SQLite
Embedded database used as the default for minimal deployments.

### shadcn/ui
Component library for React used in the dashboard. Built on top of Radix UI.

### Strategy Pattern
Design pattern that allows selecting an algorithm/implementation at runtime. Used for pluggable adapters.

### Swagger
API documentation tool. OpenWA provides Swagger UI at `/api/docs`.

## T

### Tailwind CSS
Utility-first CSS framework used in the dashboard.

### TanStack Query
Library for data fetching and caching in React. Previously known as React Query.

### TypeORM
ORM for TypeScript/JavaScript that supports multiple databases.

### TypeScript
Typed superset of JavaScript used for OpenWA development.

## V

### Vite
Build tool and dev server for frontend. Used for the dashboard.

### Volume (Docker)
Persistent storage for Docker containers. OpenWA data is stored in volumes.

## W

### WAHA
WhatsApp HTTP API - a similar project that inspired OpenWA. OpenWA is built as an open-source alternative.

### WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)
SQLite journaling mode that improves concurrency. Recommended for production.

### Webhook
HTTP callback to send events to external systems when messages or other events occur.

### WebSocket
Protocol for real-time bidirectional communication. Used for:
- Dashboard real-time updates
- WhatsApp Web protocol (internal)

### whatsapp-web.js

## Z

### Zustand
State management library for React used in the dashboard.
